## Quiz for course 02 (web-scraping and pandas):
* I translated the code from python2 to python3, fixed some web-scraping algo errors  
* I skipped last 2 quiz because the origin code not work well since the websites changed and algos not work. (And I already familiar with web-scraping. Some projects I did: https://github.com/jerryzhu1/ProjectX)
* Code: 02-DataScrapingQuizzes.ipynb
* Some tricks I found (for python 3):
    * Use pickle instead of cPickle
    * Use request instead of urllib2 (Can fix 404 issue)
